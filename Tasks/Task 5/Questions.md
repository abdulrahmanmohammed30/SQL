### **1. Teachers and Classes**
- **Question**: Which teachers are teaching more than one subject, and what is the list of subjects they teach?
  - *Hint*: Use grouping and a `HAVING` clause to filter teachers teaching multiple subjects.

---

### **2. Student Enrollment and Performance**
- **Question**: For each class, find the student with the highest attendance percentage. Also, include their grade and the teacher of that class.
  - *Hint*: This will require window functions or subqueries to rank students by attendance within each class.

---

### **3. Center Capacity and Class Distribution**
- **Question**: List all centers and show the number of classes held at each center, the total number of students enrolled at each center, and the average class size. Show only the centers where the average class size is below 75% of the center's capacity.
  - *Hint*: Use joins, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` to calculate the required statistics.

---

### **4. Payments and Teacher Income**
- **Question**: Calculate the total income for each teacher from all classes they conducted. Then, find out which teacher earned the most in a specific time range (e.g., last month).
  - *Hint*: Use aggregate functions (`SUM`) and filter by date ranges in the `Payments` table.

---

### **5. Class Scheduling Conflicts**
- **Question**: Identify any scheduling conflicts where a teacher is scheduled to teach more than one class at the same time in different centers. 
  - *Hint*: Compare the start and end times of classes within the same teacher's schedule.

---

### **6. Student Performance Insights**
- **Question**: Find students who are enrolled in at least 3 classes but have an average grade lower than 50%. List their total number of classes, average grade, and attendance percentage.
  - *Hint*: Use subqueries or `HAVING` clauses to calculate average performance.

---

### **7. Attendance and Class Evaluation**
- **Question**: Which classes have less than 50% attendance on average across all students enrolled? List the class, teacher, and subject, along with the average attendance.
  - *Hint*: Aggregate attendance percentages and use `HAVING` to filter by class attendance.

---

### **8. Payments Summary by Student**
- **Question**: For each student, calculate the total amount they have paid across all classes, the number of payments made, and the most frequent payment method used.
  - *Hint*: Use aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `GROUP BY` with conditional expressions for payment method analysis.

---

### **9. Teacher Reviews and Feedback**
- **Question**: Find the teacher who has received the highest average feedback rating and has at least 10 feedback entries. Also, list their total number of feedbacks and the average rating.
  - *Hint*: Use `AVG` and `COUNT` with a `HAVING` clause to filter teachers with enough feedback entries.

---

### **10. Class Popularity and Student Diversity**
- **Question**: For each class, calculate the diversity of students based on how many different age groups are represented in the class. An age group can be categorized as: "Under 18", "18-25", "26-35", and "36+".
  - *Hint*: Use `CASE` statements to group students by age, and count distinct age groups for each class.

---

### **11. Classes vs. Center Capacity**
- **Question**: Find classes where the number of enrolled students is more than 80% of the center's capacity but less than 100%. List the center, class, subject, teacher, and current student count.
  - *Hint*: Use joins to calculate and compare class sizes with center capacities, and filter with a `HAVING` clause.

---

### **12. Income per Class Hour**
- **Question**: For each class, calculate the total income generated by the teacher, and then divide that by the total number of hours the class lasted to find the teacher’s income per hour for that specific class.
  - *Hint*: Use a combination of joins on `Payments`, `Classes`, and aggregate functions to calculate income per hour.

---

### **13. Payment Delays**
- **Question**: Identify students who have attended more than 3 classes but delayed their payments by more than 2 weeks after the class started. List the student’s name, class, and how long the payment was delayed.
  - *Hint*: Compare class start dates and payment dates using `DATEDIFF` or equivalent date functions.

---

### **14. Teachers’ Teaching Load**
- **Question**: Calculate the total number of hours each teacher is scheduled to teach across all their classes in the next month, and compare that with the maximum allowed (e.g., 40 hours per week). List any teachers who are scheduled to exceed this limit.
  - *Hint*: You’ll need to sum up the scheduled hours and filter using conditions to check if the total exceeds the given limit.

---

### **15. Popular Subjects**
- **Question**: Identify the most popular subjects based on total student enrollment across all centers, and rank them. Also, provide the number of classes held for each subject.
  - *Hint*: Group by subjects and use ranking functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()` to rank the subjects.
